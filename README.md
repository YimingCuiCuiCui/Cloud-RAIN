# Cloud-RAIN: Point Cloud Analysis With Reflectional-Invariance

This repository is an official implementation of the paper "Cloud-RAIN: Point Cloud Analysis With Reflectional-Invariance". Code will be released soon, stay tuned!

**Tip:** The result of point cloud experiment usually faces greater randomness than 2D image. We suggest you run your experiment more than one time and select the best result.
